# update-XRPL-orderbook
A simple nodejs script using ripple-lib which you can modify to create, sign, and submit offers to the XRPL

In this example, we are selling XAG IOUs issued by the [Streets of Silver](https://streetsofsilver.website) Ripple Gateway for XRP.  We use the [GoldAPI.io](https://goldapi.io) and [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) APIs to fetch financial data to complete the process.

Many thanks and praise goes out to @jargoman and @jn_r of the XRPchat forums as well as Chris Clark of Ripple for their help with understanding Javascript async/await functionality and/or code examples for ripple-lib!
